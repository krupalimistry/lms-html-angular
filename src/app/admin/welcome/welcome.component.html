					<h1>Welcome to the Learning Management System (LMS) Demo</h1>
					<p class="padding_15">Learning Management System is a Web-based system for training programs and information
						sharing between individuals and/or giving them the flexibility to access it from anywhere. Authorized individuals
						have 24/7 access to this unique system through URL or through a unique User ID and Password. The Learning
						Management System goes far beyond conventional training by recording every training session, managing individual
						training requirements and reporting training progress. LMSs are Web-based and facilitate “anytime, any place, any
						pace” access to learning content and administration.</p>
					<p>LMS enables an organization to effectively train a large group of individuals spread across the organization.
