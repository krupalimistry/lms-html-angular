					<h1>Welcome to the Learning Management System (LMS) Demo</h1>
					<p class="padding_15">The LMS is a scientifically sound, evidence-based inventory that measures how employees deliver and receive feedback.
						This instrument has been designed as a valid, reliable, and fair self-report inventory that can deliver direct results
						and quantifiable solutions. Instead of guessing at how your organization can improve, we can uncover your results with
						our specially designed score reports and our personalized training programs. We understand your strengths and areas
						of opportunity, and analyze it to fit you.</p>
